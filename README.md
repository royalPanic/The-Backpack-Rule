# Sociological Experiment: The Backpack Rule
###### Brought to you by Brendon Barnes of Sociology 2018-2019; Second Semester, Red D.

# Prelude:
**This experiment was done with absolutely no permission or approval from Mr. Gaudette or school administration, and while I accept the consequences if they come, I also maintain that this is my research, not that of anyone else.**

# Introduction:
## What is the "Backpack Rule"?
In the context of Newmarket Junior Senior High School (NJSHS), the Backpack Rule is a rule put in place by the administration that is **not** currently put in place by student handbook precedent. The core of the rule is that bags of any kind are not to be kept on a student's person, but rather kept in their locker at all times. It is commonly assumed to be put in place to make bringing weapons/bombs into the classroom more difficult.

## What's the point of this experiment?
Enforcement of the backpack rule in the high school has historically been lax, and my goal in this was to determine *just how lax*. So I went ahead with an experiment that would *never* be approved to take the core of my sociology assignment and take it up a fair few levels. So instead of doing a school-sanctioned sociology project within the school, my goal was to do my experiment *on* the school, and get to the real meat of how things worked.

## Won't you get in a whole lotta' trouble for all this?

Yeah, probably. That's okay though, I'm doing it for *science*.

# Materials Required to Reproduce:
###### This is a list of materials required to reproduce the experiment **exactly** how it currently stands.
* A school with an (at least fairly) similar "backpack rule"
* A messenger bag, or other bag that can be used for transporting school materials *while not explicitly being a backpack*.
* A GitHub account.
* A place in which they may record data, a spreadsheet is recommended.

# General Experiment Procedure:
###### This is a set of instructions designed to assist others in reproducing this experiment, which I encourage them to do, and to even add their data to the "Public Data" document in this repository via git fork and pull.
* Firstly, create a GitHub repository and a spreadsheet. These will be our primary ways of storing our gathered data, and the spreadsheet will help with charts later if you choose to make them.
* This part may take a while, but go to school, and every day, every class, bring your bag with you. Obviously, the larger the sample size, the better.
* **Record how many times you are made to remove your bag from the room of each class, and make a note if the person asking is an administrator rather than the teacher.**

# Interlude:
## Trends in the Backpack Rule:
Before we get onto the data and conclusions, let's take a moment to look at some anecdotal trends in the enforcement of the backpack rule and what they may be caused by.
### Immediately Following School Shootings:
The reasoning for this one should be fairly obvious, and it is a common trend in our school to see enforcement of *all* rules rise immediately following a school shooting. However, something of extreme interest to me personally is that in the aftermath of our latest school shooting (which is at the time of writing the STEM Highlands Ranch Shooting in Colorado) there *was no uptick* in the enforcement of rules. If you want to know more about why I think this is, you can read my article about it [here](https://medium.com/@royal.Panic/stolen-lives-how-many-is-too-many-c628f130bcb9).
