# Prelude:
**This experiment was done with absolutely no permission or approval from Mr. Gaudette or school administration, and while I accept the consequences if they come, I also maintain that this is my research, not that of anyone else.**

# Introduction:
## What is the "Backpack Rule"?
In the context of Newmarket Junior Senior High School (NJSHS), the Backpack Rule is a rule put in place by the administration that is **not** currently put in place by student handbook precedent. The core of the rule is that bags of any kind are not to be kept on a student's person, but rather kept in their locker at all times.

## What's the point of this experiment?
Enforcement of the backpack rule in the high school has historically been lax, and my goal in this was to determine *just how lax*. So I went ahead with an experiment that would *never* be approved to take the core of my sociology assignment and take it up a fair few levels. So instead of doing a school-sanctioned sociology project within the school, my goal was to do my experiment *on* the school, and get to the real meat of how things worked.

## Won't you get in a whole lotta' trouble for all this?
